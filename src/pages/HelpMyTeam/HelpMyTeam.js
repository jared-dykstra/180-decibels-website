    <h1>Help my Team</h1>
    <p>
      Are you a manager or leader who is frustrated by your team’s results? Is
      there confusion on who is accountable for what? Do team members KNOW what
      they need to do EACH DAY to meet targets?

    <p>
      I have much more confidence and feel like I am achieving something in a
      day. I have a tonne more motivation to work on what I am supposed to be
      working on.

      Maybe your company grew very quickly or maybe you have people in seats
      that were never trained to manage…that is all very normal. But an
      undirected team operates naturally in survival mode which quickly leads to
      overwhelm. Without clear accountability and day-to-day discipline, teams
      get bogged down and performance suffers.
    </p>

    <p>
      At 180, we let you set the direction while we saturate your organization
      with a proven process for getting where you want to go.
    </p>
