        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Maybe your company grew very quickly or maybe you have people in seats
          that were never trained to manage…that is all very normal. But an
          undirected team operates naturally in survival mode which quickly
          leads to overwhelm. Without clear accountability and day-to-day
          discipline, teams get bogged down and performance suffers (along with
          morale).

        <Quote right cite="John, Executive Director" className={classes.quote}>
          My very first sit down with 180 Decibels was eye opening, to say the
          least. From the first few questions I knew that I had much to discover
          and was about to enter a learning cycle that would take me to a great
          future. I am discovering new aspects of myself and how I can cooperate
          and lead my team.

          We offer the following services to help your company:
        </Typography>

        <h2>Operations</h2>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          We focus on the People side of Operations. As managers we really only
          have one accountability: to get the maximum amount of productivity out
          of our teams at the lowest cost possible. We work with clients to
          remove complexity and get there quickly and easily.
        </Typography>

        <h2>Organization and Team Health</h2>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Unhealthy teams produce mediocre results at best. “Health” sounds
          vague, but it is easy to measure. Healthy teams have minimal politics
          and confusion, boast high morale and productivity and very low
          turnover of good people. 180 Decibels provides objective metrics and
          removes the complexity from managing your team.
        </Typography>

        <h2>Enterprise Performance Management</h2>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Performance measurement strives to set measurable short-term goals
          through the lens of long-term objectives. We help design and build
          leading measures that provide a gauge of success.
        </Typography>

        <h2>People Advisory Services</h2>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Rapid speed of innovation, for many industries, has reduced the
          advantage that we used to get from technology or product cycles alone.
          It has become clear that the most competitive and successful
          organizations are that way because of their people. Every organization
          should know how to gain a competitive advantage through its people.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          In our world, knowing whether you have the right people in the right
          roles can actually be an objective exercise. We help clients analyze
          their people through the lenses of long-term objectives, short term
          objectives, values and unique role accountabilities. In parallel, we
          engage team members and nurture the culture to create the right
          environment for a high performing team.
