      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Our founders are come-from-the trenches managers who have developed and
        built products and services, grown (and shrunk) teams in high-growth
        (and stagnant) environments and faced most of the challenges you have
        either experienced or imagined.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        We&apos;ve pivoted, down-sized, right-sized, re-vectored, in-sourced,
        out-sourced and been in and out of the box. Now, smarter and wiser, we
        have distilled our experiences into one efficient process that teaches
        overworked, frustrated managers with underperforming teams how to get on
        track.

            Dayton brings an abundance of obvious business experience in a well

            and kept us from becoming mired in too much extraneous detail.
