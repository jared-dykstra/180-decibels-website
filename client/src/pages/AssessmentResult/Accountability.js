      Companies that end up failing or leading a mediocre existence fail because
      of inability to plan and <i>execute their plan</i>--NOT because of a lack
      of vision or imagination. There are many reasons why this happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strategic thinking, execution planning and people-role-fit decisions are
      essential in defining the what, why and who components of a business. But,
      ultimately people need to actually get things done.

      At the end of every quarter you should be able to look back and see that
      every single important task and objective is complete, done properly and
      on-time. Of course, this means that we need to start each quarter with a
      firm list of priorities to start with. A well executing team knows not
      only what to do but also, what not-to-do.

      Tips to make your organization stronger in day to day accountability and
      execution.
    </h5>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <Action>Carve out time for strategy and planning</Action> - Put in the
          time necessary to build a defined vision, core purpose, core values,
          ideal customer. This is hopefully obvious but if the team doesn’t
          really understand what the organization is trying to do we can&apos;t
          expect them to do the things to get us there. To quote some great
          strategists, Alice and The Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland by
          Lewis Carroll:
        </p>
        <blockquote style={{ paddingLeft: '2em' }}>
          “Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
          <br />
          “That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.” <br /> “I
          don&apos;t much care where –” “Then it doesn&apos;t matter which way
          you go.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          If you are a middle manager who doesn&apos;t have influence on the
          overall strategy remember that you can still define an execution plan
          for your department or team. And, you should. Both, for the sanity of
          your team and yourself. Your plan and ability to execute on it is also
          a powerful way to show your manager(s) how competent you are.

      <li>
        <Action>Develop an Accountability Chart</Action> - In the world of
        accountability, when two people are accountable – nobody is accountable.
        When everyone clearly understands what they are accountable for they are
        far more likely to do it. Ideally, an Accountability Chart is developed
        as part of execution planning but, if not, that&apos;s ok. Do it now.
        Ensure that everyone knows what they are uniquely accountable for - that
        no one else it. This may sound academic however, trust me, it is a
        powerful tool.
      </li>
      <li>
        <Action>Make everything measurable</Action> - When tasks and
        deliverables are too vague they are subject to assumption and
        misinterpretation. What one person thinks is “done” sometimes isn&apos;t
        even close to what someone would call “done”. I am resisting the
        temptation to write example after example of real-life scenarios that I
        have seen however, I am sure that you can think of situations where a
        person got something that wasn&apos;t even close to what they expected
        which, caused frustration for both sides. Use the filters of specific,
        measurable with a firm deadline.
      </li>
      <li>
        <Action>
          Share, communicate, publish and ensure alignment on the plan
        </Action>{' '}
        - There is a significant amount of psychological proof about the raw
        leverage that is generated from publishing results. It dramatically
        increases motivation to complete tasks on time. This effect is leveraged
        in everything from sports to school honor-roles and competitive
        leaderboards. If you are not leveraging this simple tool to your
        advantage we strongly suggest you do.
      </li>
      <li>
        <Action>Keep Score</Action> - Ok, imagine that you are in a submarine
        and you can’t communicate with your team. The radio operator brings you
        a sheet of paper with numbers on it. Those numbers tell you exactly how
        your organization is doing. What would those numbers be for your
        business? And, who is accountable for each number? Why it is important?
        Tracking the right numbers will give you an absolute pulse on your
        organization. By putting one person’s name each ensures that
        accountabilities for each metric will be understood by all.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <Action>Have deliberate weekly Accountability Meetings</Action> - Who
          actually enjoys meetings? Perhaps, hyper-social personalities like
          them but, for most of us they often seem like a waste of time. They
          can be distracting and stop us from doing “real” work. Many of us have
          been to meetings where there was no agenda, no specific decisions to
          be make and no action items assigned at the end of the meeting. So,
          what was the meeting for, exactly?
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, imagine a meeting where there IS a specific agenda. Where
          everyone in attendance is held accountable for their numbers and
          tasks. A meeting where the most important issues are tabled, discussed
          and solved with the solution assigned to one person to be completed by
          a specific date.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well-run Accountability Meetings have another major built in effect.
          When we know that we are going to be called out for completing a task
          and hitting our numbers publicly, in front of the whole team we tend
          to step up and get it done. Use this behavior to your advantage.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <Action>Deal with behavior not aligned with the Core Values</Action> -
          Many of us have worked in environments where co-workers made us
          uncomfortable or even angry. Where people seemed to get away with
          doing a poor job. Where there was regular drama and conflict. One
          could create a long list of the possible unfavourable effects of
          working with people who had attitude and behavior problems that
          negatively impacted the team. It is even worse, when you are the
          manager of a dysfunctional team that doesn&apos;t get things done,
          complains and is routinely in conflict because, the manager is
          expected to ‘fix’ it.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the key deliverables of a complete strategic plan is a
          well-considered set of Core Values. I admit that many of us, myself
          included, have an inherent distrust of anyone who brings up the idea
          of Core Values. It sounds too soft. Too touchy-feely. Too
          marketing-fluff-ish. One of the 180Decibels guiding principles is that
          every tool we recommend is measurable. So, how do Core Values fit in
          ‘measurable’? Well-thought out Core Values define specific attitudes
          and behaviors that are expected from every single person. Many
          companies have wordsmithed Core Values that are so vague and flowery
          that they are not useful. Great Core Values are easy to measure. Does
          Billy, or Billy-Jean, exhibit this Core Value most of the time or not.
          It should take less than a second to answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assuming that your Core Values makes sense and are measurable then you
          need to ensure that every single person is aligned with them.
          Acknowledge folks with they are in sync and call them out when they
          are coloring outside the lines.
