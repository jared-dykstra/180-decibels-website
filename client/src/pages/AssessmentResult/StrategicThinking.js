        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          <Action>Take the time and rise above it</Action> - You have to take
          the time to get out of and above the business every month or two. By
          definition this requires that the visionary or visionaries in the
          organization deliberately get themselves out of the day to day
          activity to imagine the future from a more objective perspective. To
          see a clear path through the forest you have to climb a tree once in
          while to identify the best path through the trees.
        </Typography>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          <Action>Be specific</Action> - Define goals as specific &amp;
          measurable as possible with firm deadlines. To be a{' '}
          <i>&quot;successful company&quot;</i> is virtually meaningless but, if
          you make it more specific it can drive behavior and serve as a
          powerful lens for decision making. Something like this would be light
          years better:{' '}
          <i>
            &quot;In May 2029 we will have a market cap of 2 billion dollars,
            have offices in 16 major cities, have 1000 employees and be the
            unchallenged market leader in the Portuguese market.&quot;

          <Action>Ensure leadership alignment</Action> - It is critical that the
          entire leadership team is on exactly the same page. They must be able
          to envision the future and believe that it is both important and
          achievable. Defining quantifiable objectives future achievements
          tangible and the entire organization understands how they are
          contributing to the vision.

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          <Action>Good enough is good enough</Action> - Do it all even if you
          just do it good-enough. The goal should not be perfection. Things
          change to quickly. Make the best decisions possible with the
          information you have RIGHT NOW.{' '}

          <Action>Create an Accountability Chart</Action> - A clear breakdown of
          unique Accountabilities so that everyone knows exactly what they--and
          everyone else--is on the hook for.

          <Action>Communicate the plan again, again and again</Action> - Publish
          it and make sure everyone understands it. The importance of sharing
          the vision and plan with everyone. Many companies have plenty of
          strategic thinking but it is important that everyone in the
          organization understands it. Publishing both the vision and the plan
          to achieve it allows everyone in the organization to make decisions
          aligned with the vision. People need constant reaffirmation of the
          plan or they will become distracted and lose touch with the bigger
          goals.{' '}

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          <Action>Keep score</Action> - We canâ€™t tell if we are winning or
          losing unless we keep score. Define measurable data to help gauge
          whether the team and individuals are on track on a week to week basis.
          For example, if the quarterly new customer goal is 500 then work
          backwards to figure out how many times each salesperson needs to pick
          up the phone every week to make that happen. Then measure it. This
          will allow you to know within a week whether they are on track or not
          and adjust accordingly.{' '}
