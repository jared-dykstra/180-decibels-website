    <h4>Why this Strategy &amp; Planning so important?</h4>
    <p>
      This competency is achieved by doing several things well at the leadership
      level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Focused strategic thinking should define both the Why an organization
      exists. What you plan to achieve. The next step is Execution Planning
      which details How you are going to do it.
    </p>
    <h5>Components of a comprehensive strategic plan include:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <Action>Long-term timeline</Action> - A clear definition of the how the
        organization will look at a specific points in the future - in 10, 3 and
        1 years, for example. Defined as specifically and measurable ways as
        possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <Action>Core Purpose</Action> - Define your organizational our Core
        Purpose in terms of: what you can do better than anyone else. Another
        way to look at the Core Purpose is that it helps you identify what
        not-to-do.
      </li>
      <li>
        <Action>Core Values</Action> - Organizations that have clearly defined
        Core Values - and use them for hiring, firing and rewarding - understand
        their culture and actively maintain it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <Action>Ideal Customer and a go-to-market plan</Action> - A defined
        Ideal Customer and target market including geographic, demographic and
        psychographic details. Psychographic profiling helps everyone understand
        how the ideal customer thinks and makes decisions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <Action>Short-term priorities</Action>A short list of the most important
        objectives that the company must achieve in the next 30-90 days.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>
      Top tips to increase competency in the strategy and execution planning.
    </h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <Action>Take the time and rise above it</Action> - You have to take the
        time to get out of and above the business every month or two. By
        definition this requires that the visionary or visionaries in the
        organization deliberately get themselves out of the day to day activity
        to imagine the future from a more objective perspective. To see a clear
        path through the forest you have to climb a tree once in while to
        identify the best path through the trees.
      </li>
      <li>
        <Action>Be specific</Action> - Define goals as specific &amp; measurable
        as possible with firm deadlines. To be a{' '}
        <i>&quot;successful company&quot;</i> is virtually meaningless but, if
        you make it more specific it can drive behavior and serve as a powerful
        lens for decision making. Something like this would be light years
        better:{' '}
        <i>
          &quot;In May 2029 we will have a market cap of 2 billion dollars, have
          offices in 16 major cities, have 1000 employees and be the
          unchallenged market leader in the Portuguese market.&quot;
        </i>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Action>Ensure leadership alignment</Action> - It is critical that the
        entire leadership team is on exactly the same page. They must be able to
        envision the future and believe that it is both important and
        achievable. Defining quantifiable objectives future achievements
        tangible and the entire organization understands how they are
        contributing to the vision.
      </li>
      <li>
        <Action>Good enough is good enough</Action> - Do it all even if you just
        do it good-enough. The goal should not be perfection. Things change to
        quickly. Make the best decisions possible with the information you have
        RIGHT NOW.{' '}
      </li>
      <li>
        <Action>Create an Accountability Chart</Action> - A clear breakdown of
        unique Accountabilities so that everyone knows exactly what they--and
        everyone else--is on the hook for.
      </li>
      <li>
        <Action>Communicate the plan again, again and again</Action> - Publish
        it and make sure everyone understands it. The importance of sharing the
        vision and plan with everyone. Many companies have plenty of strategic
        thinking but it is important that everyone in the organization
        understands it. Publishing both the vision and the plan to achieve it
        allows everyone in the organization to make decisions aligned with the
        vision. People need constant reaffirmation of the plan or they will
        become distracted and lose touch with the bigger goals.{' '}
      </li>
      <li>
        <Action>Keep score</Action> - We canâ€™t tell if we are winning or losing
        unless we keep score. Define measurable data to help gauge whether the
        team and individuals are on track on a week to week basis. For example,
        if the quarterly new customer goal is 500 then work backwards to figure
        out how many times each salesperson needs to pick up the phone every
        week to make that happen. Then measure it. This will allow you to know
        within a week whether they are on track or not and adjust accordingly.{' '}
