        If you are tempted to ignore this one because it sounds too touchy-feely
        then just bear with me and keep reading. Our goal at 180Decibels is to
        make potentially slippery concepts more tangible and therefore, useful.

      When staff are not getting things done, are disengaged and unhappy in
      their work, doing work poorly or too slowly, causing drama and being
      disrespectful to peers or customers, we all agree that it is a significant
      problem. It is a problem for them, for peers, for you as their manager and
      for the organization itself. So, who is to blame?
    </Typography>
    <h2>Tough-love time...</h2>
    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
      It is ultimately the manager’s fault for a poor performing unhappy team
      member. Ultimately, the primary accountability of any manager is to ensure
      that their team is high performing and healthy.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
      Now, before you get defensive, please allow me to clarify. It is important
      to try and understand the source of the behavior. That may make you feel
      like rolling your eyes but again, bear with me. Behavior is inextricably
      linked to the environment and circumstances that a person finds them in.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
      Even a person that is fundamentally wired to work hard, achieve and
      succeed can become toxic if they don’t get firm direction, clear guidance
      on how they succeed and credit for doing a good job. If you add in the
      effects of an office culture where non-performers are not held accountable
      for poor performance, shoddy work and missed deadlines and you have the
      recipe to make a potential A-player into a Toxic B-player or, worse.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
      This may seem like an overwhelming situation to many managers who don’t
      want to fire someone based on personality conflict.(Never mind all of the
      work it takes to hire and train someone else. Yuck.)
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
      The good news is that there are simple disciplines and tools at the heart
      of the 180Decibels methodology. Essentially, all you have to do is
      evaluate individuals against well-defined Core Values and keep track of
      how they do with their short-term priorities, unique Accountabilities and
      track any issues related to individuals and their performance. Easy,
      right? Well, the way we do it, it is easy.

    <h2>
      Organizations that are healthy and productive have engaged employees.
    </h2>
    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
      Why is this important?
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
      Because, engaged employees are productive employees who are motivated to
      achieve, and are less likely to quit. Turnover is expensive and
      distracting especially when we lose our best team members. If we
      don&apos;t engage our best people, we will ultimately lose them.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
      So, how do we engage our employees?
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
      Well, this is an ongoing debate among managers and academics alike, but it
      is important to understand that it is possible to boil things down to
      tactical tools. When you know the essentials, the truth is not that
      complicated. Of course, it does take some effort but, it isn&apos;t magic.
      Anyone can do it. Seriously. Anyone. We just have to take some deliberate
      steps.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
      The most significant factors in employee engagement are{' '}
      <i>
        &quot;leader empowering behavior, role clarity and psychological
        empowerment.&quot;
      </i>{' '}
      (Fallen Mendes, Marius W. Stander) Psychological empowerment is a result
      of employees feeling that they have competence and meaning in their roles.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
      Notice that “empowerment” is mentioned twice. Role clarity is another huge
      factor. Ok, you may be asking, first “engagement”, now he’s talking about
      “empowerment”. How is that practical advice? It is very important. The
      good news is that you can satisfy your employees need for engagement -
      through empowerment - by doing a few simple things.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
      To achieve role clarity staff needs to know exactly what is expected, how
      their success is measured, what they are uniquely accountable for and what
      they are expected to accomplish in the next 90 days - or sooner. Many
      managers assume that staff knows based on title or job description but
      that is often not enough information.

          <Action>Maintain singular focus and direction for 90 days</Action> -
          Depending on the nature of your business, the timelines may vary but
          it is important to understand that when priorities change too often it
          causes confusion and stress to team members and can radically reduce
          how much time they are being productive simply because they lose sight
          of what is important.

          <Action>Give the gift of Autonomy</Action> - Engaged employees often
          have an element of autonomy baked into their roles. This can be
          accomplished simply by ensuring that each person has unique
          Accountabilities - with decision making authority. The general rules
          is that only 1 person can be accountable for each major function. In
          the world of accountability, when two people are accountable – nobody
          is accountable. Now, for front-line staff it is important that your
          frame out their role so that they understand the boundaries. Which, is
          covered in the next Tip.

      </li>
      <li>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          <Action>Tell them how their success will be measured</Action> - This
          can be done ideally, with numbers or with a clear definition of what
          &apos;done&apos; looks like for specific tasks or projects. Take the
          time to understand how they are doing with a task or project and offer
          guidance when they need it. As you can imagine managing performance is
          far, far easier if tasks are easy to measure. This lets you easily
          measure is it, done or not-done?
        </Typography>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          <Action>Build an Accountability Chart</Action> - Ensure that everyone
          understands what they are uniquely accountable for. This is also
          discussed under Autonomy because it is so important. If you want your
          people to step-up or, if you just want people to stop dropping the
          ball, then give them clear unique Accountabilities that are different
          than anyone else&apos;s. Create an Accountability Chart. It is a
          powerful and yet underutilized tool.
        </Typography>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          <Action>Communicate and reinforce the Core Values</Action> - Make sure
          that everyone fully understands the expected behaviors and attitudes
          (expressed in the Core Values). Acknowledge them for having a positive
          attitude, showing initiative, going above and beyond for customers or,
          whatever is inline with your published Core Values. And, when a
          person&apos;s behavior is too far outside the lines then help them
          understand that they are outside and that the need to modify their
          behavior and keep it in alignment with the organizational values.

      </li>
      <li>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          <Action>Ensure that the leadership team is fully aligned</Action> - It
          is far too common for managers and leaders to undermine each other in
          front of staff. Even if you don&apos;t fully agree with decisions, it
          is vital that you defend and support decisions made at the exec and
          management levels.
        </Typography>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          <Action>Define short term objectives; and assign them</Action> -
          Nothing drives positive behavior like specific short-term measurable
          goals. Give each team member a short-list of things they need to
          complete in the next week or as long as within the next 90-days. The
          priorities need to be aligned with the strategy and plan, obviously.
          Make sure that each priority is specific, measurable and has a firm
          deadline.
